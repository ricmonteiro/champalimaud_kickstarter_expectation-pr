				<p>This is the page with a detailed description of the rigs used in the mouse room to train mice in visual expectation tasks.</p>

				<header id="rig_schematics">Rig overall schematics</header>
				<p>The general structure of the rig is presented in the figure. The mouse is in the center, on top of the wheel. 
					In the front, a screen is centered on the mouse's snout, at aprox. 17cm from the mouse. 
					There's a camera on the right with an infrared (IR) light above it. On the center of the wheel there is an analog encoder. Right in front of the mouse, a spout for reward delivery. </p>
					<p>Outside the rig there is the Harp Behavior board, where the camera and the water valve connect.</p>

				<header id="screen">Screen</header>
				<p>The screen is a Adafruits 10.1" Display (HDMI 4 Pi - 10.1" Display 1280x800 IPS - HDMI/VGA/NTSC/PAL). It's connect the the computer's GPU.</p>

				<header id="wheel">Wheel</header>
				<p>TThe wheel is an acrylic 3D-printed in-house. It's connected to an analog encoder
					 (MAE3 Absolute Encoder, Analog 10-Bit, 6mm Bore, .500" Shaft Length, .750" Bolt Circle, Bulk Packaged)</p>

				<header id="camera">Camera</header>
				The camera (Chameleon3 USB, CM3-U3-13Y3C-S-BD) records videos and is used for lick detection. It's frame rate is controlled by the Harp Behavior board.

				<header id="IR_light">IR Light</header>
				The IR Light serves to get a better image quality on Mono mode camera. Neither humans nor mice see the light coming from the lamp and it's used to be able to record video in a dark environment. It should be pointed directly to the mouse's snout.

				<header id="bonsai">Bonsai</header>
				<p>Bonsai is a reactive programing framework that allows hardware control and live data acquisition. It's design is intuitive and the framework was built by a CCU PhD student called Gon√ßalo Lopes.</p>

				<header id="Workflow">Workflow</header>
				<p>Workflow contains the several components of the code that controls the hardware and acquires the data. Next, details of each main section are described.

			<section class="main-section">
				<header id="signal_settings">Signal settings</header>
				<p>In signal settings, the signal coming from the encoder is processed and integrated in the visual stimuli. The raw signal of the encoder oscilates between 0 and 5V. Here, these values are converted between 0 and 60cm (full wheel perimeter) and absolute distance covered by the mouse.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="main-section">
				<header id="screen_settings">Screen settings</header>
                <p>In screen settings, all things related to the screen are configured. The frames and timestamped and registed with HarpBehavior.</p>                
			</section>
			<section class="main-section">
				<header id="stimuli_series">Stimuli series</header>
				<p>Stimuli series contains the epochs of the task and it's configurations. Here, you control the stimulus settings such as position, contrast and spatial frequency. You can also set the distance for each epoch, the cueing configuration (true or false cue) and reward delivery.</p>

			<section class="main-section">
				<header id="camera_settings">Camera settings</header>
				<p><In camera settings, the video recording is set and the lick detection is implemented. Also, a separate video is recorded for the mouse's pupil./p>
